# Project Requirements

## How do I complete this project?
* Review JavaScript design patterns and object-oriented JavaScript.
* Review the Knockout.js framework.
* Review and implement the Google Maps API.
* Add map markers of interesting locations in the neighborhood.
* Add a search bar functionality to search and filter your map markers. There should be a filtering function on markers that already show up. Simply providing a search function through a third-party API is not enough.
* Implement a list view of the identified locations.
* Add third-party APIs when a map marker, search result, or list view entry is clicked (ex. Yelp reviews, Wikipedia, StreetView/Flickr images, etc).
